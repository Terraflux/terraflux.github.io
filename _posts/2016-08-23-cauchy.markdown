Round Two! In order to get a little deeper into describing these particular matrices, we will have to maintain definitions for how they are structured. This is how a matrix is defined:

Here is the definition for a Cauchy Matrix:

$$ {A}\_{i, j} = \frac{1}{x\_{i} - y\_{j}} $$

$$ {x}\_{i} - {y}\_{j} \neq 0 $$

$$ 1 \le {i} \le {m} $$

$$ 1 \le {j} \le {n} $$
